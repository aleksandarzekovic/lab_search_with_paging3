# Lab Search with Paging3

In this project, I conducted an in-depth exploration into utilizing the Paging3 library for the effective implementation of caching and pagination features. By focusing on these two critical aspects, I aimed to optimize data handling, enhance the user experience, and improve the overall performance of the app.

**_NOTE:_**  To utilize this app, you'll need to create a keystore.properties file in the root directory of your project. Within this file, add your TMDB_API_KEY for the app to function correctly.
